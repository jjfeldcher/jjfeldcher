### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You may recognize me as the moderator and mentor from the HackerOne 101 Community.
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/32ZNZVN)
Or you may know me from any of my repositories which serve to solve Web Security issues or assist security researchers in fixing bugs. Also from any of my Flipper Zero contributions.

Contacting me through my Discord by joining the link and messaging me is the most efficient way to get a hold of me; if it is something urgent outside of a PR or issue ticket.

Thanks for stopping by!
